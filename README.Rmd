> A consistent interface for managing connections to database and compute engines.

This package is currently under active development. The API is likely to change and some features are incomplete.

## Features

The goal of `dbmanager` is to provide connection management to the following databases and compute engines.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
yes <- ":heavy_check_mark:"
no <- ":heavy_multiplication_x:"

features <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Engine, ~Implemented,
  "MySQL",        yes,
  "PostgreSQL",   yes,
  "SQL Server",   no,
  "MonetDB",      no,
  "SQLite",       no,
  "CouchDB",      no,
  "MongoDB",      no,
  "Spark",        no
)
knitr::kable(features, align = "lc")
```

## Installation

`dbmanager` is not yet on CRAN. You can install from GitHub with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("eokodie/dbmanager", ref = "main")
```

## Examples

`dbmanager` is implemented with R6 classes to give a consistent interface to common databases and compute engines.

You can connect to a MySQL database with.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dbmanager)

db <- MySQL$new(
  db_name  = "mydb",
  host     = "test1", 
  user     = "user1", 
  password = "pwd1"
)

db$available_databases
db$connected_database
db$tables
# You can also get the pool object to run queries etc.
pool <- db$pool

db$close()
```

Similarly, you can connect to PostgreSQL with.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dbmanager)

db <- PostgreSQL$new(
  db_name  = "mydb2",
  host     = "test2", 
  user     = "user2", 
  password = "pwd2"
)

db$available_databases
db$connected_database
db$tables
pool <- db$pool

db$close()
```
