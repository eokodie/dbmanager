> A consistent interface for managing connections to database and compute engines.

This package is currently under development. The API is likely to change and some features are incomplete.

## Features

The goal of dbmanager is to provide connection management to the following databases and compute engines.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
yes <- ":heavy_check_mark:"
no <- ":heavy_multiplication_x:"

features <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Engine, ~Implemented,
  "MySQL",        no,
  "PostgreSQL",   no,
  "SQL Server",   no,
  "MonetDB",      no,
  "SQLite",       no,
  "CouchDB",      no,
  "Spark",        no
)
knitr::kable(features, align = "c")
```

## Installation

**dbmanager** is not yet on CRAN. You can install from GitHub with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("eokodie/dbmanager")
```
