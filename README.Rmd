> A consistent interface for managing connections to database and compute engines.

This package is currently under active development. The API is likely to change and some features are incomplete.

## Features

The goal of `dbmanager` is to provide connection management to the following databases and compute engines.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
yes <- ":heavy_check_mark:"
no <- ":heavy_multiplication_x:"

features <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Engine, ~Implemented,
  "MySQL",        yes,
  "PostgreSQL",   yes,
  "SQL Server",   yes,
  "MonetDB",      yes,
  "SQLite",       no,
  "CouchDB",      no,
  "MongoDB",      no,
  "Spark",        no
)
knitr::kable(features, align = "lc")
```

## Installation

`dbmanager` is not yet on CRAN. You can install from GitHub with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("eokodie/dbmanager", ref = "main")
```

## Examples

`dbmanager` is implemented with R6 classes to give a consistent interface to common databases and compute engines. We will illustrate this with some code snippets.

Let's begin with these credentials.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
db_name  = Sys.getenv("db_name")
host     = Sys.getenv("host") 
user     = Sys.getenv("user") 
password = Sys.getenv("password")
```


We can connect to a MySQL database with.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dbmanager)

db <- MySQL$new(
  db_name  = db_name,
  host     = host, 
  user     = user, 
  password = password
)

db$available_databases
#> [1] "test_db"                   "information_schema"       
#> [3] "mysql"                     "performance_schema"       
#> [5] "previous_close_prices_db"  "sys"                      
#> [7] "example_db"

db$connected_database
#> [1] "information_schema"

db$tables
#>  [1] "ADMINISTRABLE_ROLE_AUTHORIZATIONS"    
#>  [2] "APPLICABLE_ROLES"                     
#>  [3] "CHARACTER_SETS"                       
#>  [4] "CHECK_CONSTRAINTS"                    
#>  [5] "COLLATIONS"                           
#>  [6] "COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY"
#>  [7] "COLUMNS"                              
#>  [8] "COLUMNS_EXTENSIONS"                   
#>  [9] "COLUMN_PRIVILEGES"                    
#> [10] "COLUMN_STATISTICS"                    
#> [11] "ENABLED_ROLES"                        
#> [12] "ENGINES"                              
#> [13] "EVENTS"                               
#> [14] "FILES"                                

# You can also get the pool object to run queries etc.
pool <- db$pool

DBI::dbListTables(pool)
#>  [1] "ADMINISTRABLE_ROLE_AUTHORIZATIONS"    
#>  [2] "APPLICABLE_ROLES"                     
#>  [3] "CHARACTER_SETS"                       
#>  [4] "CHECK_CONSTRAINTS"                    
#>  [5] "COLLATIONS"                           
#>  [6] "COLLATION_CHARACTER_SET_APPLICABILITY"

db$close()
```

Similarly, we can connect to PostgreSQL with.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dbmanager)

db <- PostgreSQL$new(
  db_name  = db_name,
  host     = host, 
  user     = user, 
  password = password
)

db$available_databases
db$connected_database
db$tables
pool <- db$pool

db$close()
```
